# Fin Quotes Service

Service for fetching and saving actual financial quotes values.

---

## About

This service allows you to asynchronously request and update currency pair quotes (exchange rates).
Updating a quote is performed in the background: the user receives an update request ID, then can later retrieve the result by this ID.

Quote data is stored in PostgreSQL.  
A background worker picks up update tasks from the queue, fetches rates from an external API (with emulated delay for 30s for testing), and saves the result.

Only 4 currencies are supported: USD/EUR, EUR/USD, USD/MXN, EUR/MXN (as test examples)
